clock
=====

The built in JavaScript Date Object works as follows:

```
var d = new Date();
console.log( d );
```

> Date {Tue Dec 18 2012 23:38:40 GMT-0500 (EST)}

```
setTimeout( function () { console.log( d ) }, 1000 )
```

> Date {Tue Dec 18 2012 23:38:40 GMT-0500 (EST)}

While this behavior makes sense, I intuitively thought the second ```console.log``` should read one second later.

This class implements that functionality for time only - at least for now.

### Additional Details

The code in this repository is not meant to be "released" in the traditional sense.  This repository is meant to be an exploration of best practices and technologies.

#### JavaScript

Currently using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

##### Status

The class is written in CoffeeScript and I am generally pleased with the process.  There are a couple of things I haven't quite adjusted to:

 * I don't use watch, so the process of saving CoffeeScript, building it, and loading it is a bit of a pain.
 * I find that I still write my code in JavaScript first, then convert it to CoffeeScript.  Is this common?
 * The [CoffeeScript Cookbook](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/) is great.  Read more [here](https://github.com/coffeescript-cookbook/coffeescript-cookbook.github.com)

##### To Try

 * [Google Closue](https://developers.google.com/closure/)

#### Documentation

Documentation is currently being written and formatted with [docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco).

##### Status

The documentation is currently very sparse and it's not well organized.

##### To Try

 * [JSDoc 3](http://usejsdoc.org/)

#### Build tool

Currently using [Cake](http://coffeescript.org/#cake) as the build tool.

##### Status

The following cake tasks are working:

 * cake build
 * cake doc

 Requirements are handled in the Cakefile, but they are not very user friendly.  Furthermore, pygments is a
 prerequisite, but it's not handle in the Cakefile.  A failure to have pygments results in no html being generated by docco, but there's no error message.

##### To Try

 * [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

#### Testing

Currently using [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) for a testing framework.

##### Status

There are currently 20 tasks, which should reasonably test whether or not the class is working.

##### To Try

 * [JS Test Runner](http://js-testrunner.codehaus.org/)

#### HTML Template

Currently using [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) as the HTML template engine.

##### Status

There is currently one, very simple jade template written for the example clock.

#### GitHub for Mac and Windows

Using a combination of [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) (at home) and [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) (at work).

##### Status

I am surprised at how pleasant the experience is.  I still rely on the commandline for some things out of muscle memory or the wrong kind of laziness.  I like it better than integration with the various IDE that I use that I'm slowly learning that alt-tab to the GitHub app isn't actually painful.

#### Sublime Text 2

Currently editing this project in a trial version of Sublime Text 2.

##### Status

It's hard to give up emacs after twenty years, but Sublime Text 2 makes it a lot easier.  I will be $59 poorer soon, but much happier to not be teased for using emacs.
